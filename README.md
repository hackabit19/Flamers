# SAFE INTERNET USAGE
* The internet is a wonderful and informative platform. While we can leverage its potential to gain information about anything and everything, it also brings a lot of potential risk. The vulnarability while exploring the web brings a risk of showcasing us along with the children, with certain information which might bring a feeling of uncomfortability, destruction etc.
* Violent scenes are “scenes one would not let an 8 year old child see because they contain physical violence”. 

This GitHub repository is intended to automatically classify the video content into violent or non-violent using the method of Deep Learning.

The visual and audio dataset information has been collected from Hollywood Movies and YouTube.
The folder [annotations] contain the textual information about the violance annotations of the visual and audio modelarity. It has space-separated text format where each line in the former compiles to the structure:
start-frame end-frame
whereas, each line in the latter compiles to the structure:
start-frame end-frame (concept-detail)       Or
start-second end-second (concept-detail) 

The ipynb file- [DataAnalysis] contains the analysis of textual data or the informative dataset in the form of respective clear graph for the different datils of concept.
